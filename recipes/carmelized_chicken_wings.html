<h2>Description</h2>
   
    <p>For this dish we'll need very little everyday kitchen ingredients. We are making carmelized chicken wings. These wings are just wings with a asian twist. The wings will only take a little over a hour with less then 5 mins of prep time to make them.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons of peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>12 large chicken wings, tips removed and wings cut in half at joint</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In an electric skillet or a large skillet over medium heat, mix together the water, sugar, soy sauce, peanut butter, honey, wine vinegar, and garlic until smooth and the sugar has dissolved. Place the wings into the sauce, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes. Uncover and simmer until the wings are tender and the sauce has thickened, about 30 more minutes, spooning sauce over wings occasionally. Sprinkle with sesame seeds.</li>
